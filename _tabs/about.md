Hi, I'm Alexandra but everyone calls me Sacha! I currently hold a First Class Batchelor's Degree in Computer Science and am currently working towards obtaining a Master's Degree, also in Computer Science. I would love to progress to PhD study soon. My research interests involve using computational methods to map the evolution and spread of disease. I am trying my best to be an effective science communicator through my blogs.
